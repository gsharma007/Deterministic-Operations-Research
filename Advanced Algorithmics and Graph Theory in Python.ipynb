    "***Moving within the maze***:\n",
    "So, the position (0,0) is the bottom left corner, while (width - 1, height - 1) is the top right corner. This means that increasing the value of the x coordinate, we are going to move right, while decreasing the value moves to the left. In the same way, increasing the value of the y coordinate you are going to move up, while decreasing the value moves down.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Assumption***:\n",
    "Note that in practice it is not possible to move left if x is 0, or to move right if x is width - 1. Similarly it is not possible to move down if y is 0, or to move up if y is height - 1. Nevertheless, we will ignore this for the moment. Also, we consider a maze with no wall to begin with."
